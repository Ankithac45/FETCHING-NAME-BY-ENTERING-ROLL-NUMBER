# FETCHING-NAME-BY-ENTERING-ROLL-NUMBER
## Socket Programming based Project to create a client and server system
#### When we enter the roll no of the student in the client, it sends the data to the server. In server, we create a CSV data base where the list of students with their roll numbers are stored. In server the roll no is checked in the database and the name of the student is returned to the client. If the roll number is present then the  name is displayed in the client system.
